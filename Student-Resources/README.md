## Student Resources

This directoy contains resources for the student, that will either be consumed during the classroom, or can be used by the self-guided learner. There are some instructions in the [Instructor-Resources](../Instructor-Resources) that might be useful to read before doing the exercises here.

In order to run the labs here, you'll need an R Server cluster. Instructions for creating an R Server cluster are available on the [Azure documentation webpage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-r-server-get-started).

If you're running the materials on the edge node of the cluster using RStudio Server, you'll probably want to run the rmarkdown documents in the rmarkdown directory. You can easily clone the repository to your edge node RStudio Server instance by New Project -> Version Control -> git -> paste in repository name: https://github.com/Azure/LearnAnalytics-mrs-spark.git.
